# Autonomous Quadcopter Simulation in ROS Gazebo

The project implements an autonomous quadcopter operation in gazebo simulation to shuttle between a fixed target (yellow box) and a moving target (autonomous ground bot). An Extended Kalman Filter algorithm that takes in IMU, Magnetic Compass and GPS information (from simulation) is used to estimate its position.
